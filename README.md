# SDR-Signal-Detector
Senior design project by Jared Boggs, Matthew Buker, Christopher Nguyen, and Seth Graham that is built off of GNU Radio. The project will utilize an OSMOCOM - type SDR (we developed with HackRF One) and use the device to scan and display signals within a user-specified RF range.
